<h1 id="Tyrannosaurus" style="color:Red;">Tyrannosaurus</h1>  

<p style="color:red; font-size:180%;font-weight: bold;">Tyrannosaurus was a large predatory dinosaur from 68 to 66 million years ago   

Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Compared to the large and powerful hind limbs, its forelimbs were small, but powerful for their size. They had <em>two</em> clawed fingers </p>

<h1 id="Triceratops" style="color:red;">Triceratops</h1> 

<p style="color:red;font-size:160%;font-weight: bold;">Triceratops was a huge herbivore dinosaur from the land. Its name came from having three horns on its head. They were mainly found in North America. As adults, they grew up to 30 feet long by 9 feet tall (9.1 Ã— 2.7 m), and probably weighed around 5,400 kg (12,000 lb).</p>

<h1 id=Stegosaurus style="color:red;">Stegosaurus</h1> 

<p style="color:red;font-size:160%;"><b>Stegosaurus (meaning "roof-lizard") was a type of plant-eating dinosaur which lived in what is now western North America.

Stegosaurus lived around 155 to 145 million years ago. It is one of the most easily recognized dinosaurs, with its distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates on its back, and the long spikes on its tail. The armor was necessary as it lived with such meat-eaters as Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus.</b></p>

<h1 style="color:#00cc99">Types and Groups of Dinosaurs</h1>

<p style="color:#00cc99;font-size:160%;font-weight: bold;"> there are multiple groups and classifications that dinosaurs fall under, these mostly break down into the shape, living conditions and if they are a canivore or herbivore, there is <em>Saurischian</em> which means "lizard hipped" and means that the dinosaur was mostly lizard built. the second main group is <em>Ornithischian</em> which means they are "bird hipped" or they have a bird build. both of these groups have subsections to determine which "exact" group dinosaurs are in</p>
